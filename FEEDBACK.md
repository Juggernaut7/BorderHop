## üìã **DOCUMENTATION FEEDBACK**

### 1. **CCTP V2 Webhook Error Handling Documentation**

**Issue Description:**
The CCTP V2 webhook documentation lacks clear examples of error handling for failed cross-chain transfers (e.g., insufficient liquidity or network timeouts). During BorderHop development, we encountered scenarios where webhooks failed silently or returned ambiguous error codes, making debugging extremely challenging.

**Impact on Development:**
- Forced 8+ hours of additional debugging time for failed transfers
- Risked missing critical edge cases that could affect production reliability
- Delayed integration timeline and increased development costs
- Reduced developer confidence in CCTP V2's reliability

**Suggested Improvement:**
Add comprehensive error handling documentation to developers.circle.com/cctp-v2-webhooks including:

1. **Detailed Error Payload Examples:**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY",
    "message": "Destination chain liquidity below threshold",
    "details": {
      "sourceChain": "ethereum",
      "destinationChain": "base",
      "requestedAmount": "1000.00",
      "availableLiquidity": "500.00",
      "retryAfter": "2025-09-01T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Retry Logic Implementation Guide:**
```javascript
// Example retry mechanism for failed transfers
const handleWebhookError = async (error) => {
  switch (error.code) {
    case 'INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY':
      return await retryAfterDelay(error.details.retryAfter);
    case 'NETWORK_TIMEOUT':
      return await retryWithExponentialBackoff();
    case 'INVALID_SIGNATURE':
      return await logAndAlert(error);
  }
};
```

3. **Troubleshooting Flowchart:**
- Decision tree for common error scenarios
- Recommended actions for each error type
- Escalation procedures for unresolved issues

### 2. **CCTP V2 Hook Contract Integration Guide**

**Issue Description:**
The hook contract integration documentation lacks step-by-step implementation examples for post-transfer actions. The current docs assume advanced Solidity knowledge, making it difficult for developers to implement custom hooks.

**Impact on Development:**
- Required reverse-engineering of hook patterns from examples
- Increased learning curve for non-Solidity experts
- Potential security vulnerabilities from incorrect implementations

**Suggested Improvement:**
Create a comprehensive hook implementation guide with:

1. **Template Hook Contract:**
```solidity
// Complete example hook contract
contract ExampleHook {
    function executeHook(
        bytes32 transferId,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        string calldata metadata
    ) external {
        // Implementation examples for different use cases
    }
}
```

2. **Testing Framework Setup:**
- Unit test examples for hook validation
- Integration test scenarios
- Gas optimization guidelines

### 3. **API Rate Limiting and Quotas Documentation**

**Issue Description:**
Missing information about API rate limits, quotas, and best practices for production applications. This caused unexpected throttling during BorderHop's development phase.

**Suggested Improvement:**
Add dedicated section covering:
- Rate limit thresholds for different endpoints
- Quota management strategies
- Best practices for handling rate limit responses
- Monitoring and alerting recommendations

## üêõ **PRODUCT FEEDBACK**

### 1. **CCTP V2 Transfer Status Inconsistency**

**Title:** Transfer Status Updates Show Inconsistent State During Cross-Chain Processing

**Description:** 
During BorderHop's cross-chain transfer testing, we observed that the transfer status API sometimes returns conflicting states between "processing" and "completed" for the same transfer ID. This creates confusion for users and complicates UI state management.

**Expected Result:**
Transfer status should progress linearly: `initiated` ‚Üí `processing` ‚Üí `completed` or `failed`, with consistent state representation across all API endpoints.

**Actual Result:**
Status sometimes oscillates between states, with `/api/remittance/status/{id}` returning "processing" while `/api/remittance/history/{address}` shows "completed" for the same transfer.

**Environment:**
- Operating System: Windows 11, macOS Ventura
- Browser/Version: Chrome 120.0, Firefox 121.0
- Device: Desktop
- API Version: CCTP V2 Production
- Endpoints: `/api/remittance/status/{id}`, `/api/remittance/history/{address}`

**Additional Notes:**
This issue affects user experience and requires additional client-side logic to handle inconsistent states.

### 2. **Webhook Delivery Reliability**

**Title:** Webhook Delivery Fails Silently for High-Volume Transfers

**Description:**
When processing multiple transfers simultaneously, some webhook notifications fail to deliver without any error response or retry mechanism visible to developers.

**Expected Result:**
All webhook notifications should be delivered with confirmation, or explicit failure responses with retry instructions.

**Actual Result:**
Some webhooks are lost without notification, requiring manual verification of transfer status.

**Environment:**
- Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Programming Language: Node.js 18.x
- API Version: CCTP V2 Production
- Transfer Volume: 10+ concurrent transfers

### 3. **Gas Estimation Accuracy**

**Title:** Gas Estimation API Returns Inaccurate Values for Complex Transfers

**Description:**
The gas estimation endpoint sometimes provides estimates that are significantly lower than actual gas costs, especially for transfers involving hooks or complex routing.

**Expected Result:**
Gas estimates should be within 10-15% of actual costs to help users set appropriate gas limits.

**Actual Result:**
Estimates can be 30-50% lower than actual costs, causing transaction failures.

**Environment:**
- Operating System: Windows 11
- Browser/Version: Chrome 120.0
- Device: Desktop
- API Version: CCTP V2 Production
- Endpoints: `/api/defi/gas-prices`
